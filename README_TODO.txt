*** important ToDo ***

- fill in super-res microscopy (SIM), scope comparison, individual scope pages
- ask people to review & improve personal pages (styling, more content & images)
- finish adding biochemistry, WIMM and other Oxford groups / contacts
    (check Ox bioimagers are happy for us to link to them)
- re-order left and right panel divs (i.e. right 1st in html), and float right panel 
    to right for correct Firefox display upon zoom out
- sort out GoDaddy settings (i.e. stop domain masking)
