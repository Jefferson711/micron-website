          Micron Oxford is a collaborative, multidisciplinary bioimaging unit
          working with biomedical researchers in the Oxford area and beyond to
          apply advanced cellular imaging techniques to address key questions
          in biology. We are located within the Department of Biochemistry and
          the Dunn School of Pathology in the South Parks Road science area at
          the University of Oxford, and are funded by a strategic award from
          the Wellcome Trust.

        <h3>Our Vision</h3>
        <div id="vision">
          We seek to understand the fundamental biological processes taking
          place in cells using advanced bioimaging technologies to observe
          and interfer with the components of molecular machines responsible
          for cellular function.  To achieve this goal we are:

          <ol>
            <li>Creating a collaborative and multidisciplinary environment that transcends
                departmental boundaries and fosters innovative developments in microscopy,
                molecular interference and tagging.</li>

            <li>Training pre/post-doctoral researchers in the application of advanced
                imaging and related approaches, further enabling them to answer key questions
                in their field of interest.</li>

            <li>Nurturing career development for research fellows, young PIs and support staff.</li>

            <li>Disseminating newly developed methodologies to the wider scientific community and
                providing accessible information on Centre research and technology to a lay
                audience. </li>

            Micron is a community of researchers focusing on the development and
            use of state-of-the-art microscopy methods for imaging living cells.
            These interdisciplinary collaborative research groups are based in a
            number of Department in Oxford University including, the Department
            of Biochemistry, the Dunn School of Pathology, DPAG and the Wellcome
            Trust Centre for Human Genetics. Micron is funded by a major
            strategic award from the Wellcome Trust that includes staff salaries
            and large equipment purchases.
          </p>
          <p>
            Micron will focus on the use of very recently developed and emerging
            microscopy methods that allow cell biologists to image molecules in
            living cells at resolutions that exceed the conventional resolution
            limits. Imaging single molecules in living cells will allow the
            researchers to make major new discoveries and uncover the principles
            of how molecular machines function within cells.
          </p>
          <p>
            The hub of the microscopy facilities is located in the New
            Biochemistry building where many of the groups are based. Leading
            the project are Professors Neil Brockdorff, Ilan Davis and Kim
            Nasmyth from the Biochemistry department, and Professors Nick
            Proudfoot, Jordan Raff and Elizabeth Robertson, from the Dunn
            School of Pathology. They will work with colleagues from the
            Departments of Chemistry, Engineering, Physics, and Physiology,
            Anatomy and Genetics, and at hospital sites, as well as researchers
            from the hospital sites in Oxford. Each group will bring its specific
            expertise and interest.
