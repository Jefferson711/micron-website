        <h3>Outreach activities</h3>
    
        <p>We are committed to communicating our work to 
           both the scientific community and the lay audience. For a Plain 
           English description of our activities, please read more

        <p>Studying biological structures with fine details does not only require a microscope with high resolution, but also a sample preparation process that preserves the structures in a near-native state. Live-cell imaging is restricted mostly to the field of light microscopy. For studies requiring much higher resolution, fast freezing techniques (vitrification) are successfully used to immobilize the sample in a near-native state for imaging with electron and X-ray cryo-microscopy. Fluorescence cryo-microscopy combines imaging of vitrified samples with the advantages of fluorescence labeling of biological structures, but the advantages of vitrified specimens have not been fully exploited to date in fluorescence microscopy, because of the limited resolution of 400-500 nm due to the lack of cryo-immersion objectives.</p>
        <p>We demonstrated how super-resolution imaging can be successfully applied for fluorescence cryo-microscopy to increase the resolution up to a factor of 5 at a temperature of -192°C. Using standard fluorescent proteins we were able to image biological structures in vitrified cells with a resolution of 125 nm and could locate individual molecules with an average precision of 40 nm. This technique is highly complementary to electron and X-ray cryo-microscopy and presents a powerful tool for imaging cellular structures in a near-native state at nanometer resolution.</p>

        <h4>BSCB Competition Winner 2012</h4> 
        <p>Congratulations to Sheng-Wen Chui from the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Oxford. Sheng-Wen used Micron's <a href="facilities/DVcore.shtml">Delta-Vision microscope</a> to take this superb image of filamentous cells of the bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides.</p>

        <h4>Wytham Woods Exhibition</h4>
        <p>Out of the Woods is an exhibition on Wytham Woods north of Oxford, the best studied piece of wood land in the world. The exhibition features prints and wood sculpture as well as photographs about life in the woods. We have contributed three large digital images that use fluorescence and DIC to capture the beauty of cells and organelles in bluebell leaves from Wytham Woods. The exhibition runs until 30 September 2012.</p>

<h4>Epidermis (outer layer) of a bluebell leaf showing the guard cells of two stomata and red chlorophyll autofluorescence in the chloroplasts contained within the guard cells. </h4>
<p>
Stomata are closable pores through which gas is exchanged between the leaf and the environment. During the day they allow oxygen and water vapour to leave the leaf and air to enter while during the night carbon dioxide is expelled. The guard cells are the only cells in the epidermis that contain chloroplasts where photosynthesis takes place. The tissue shown in this image is in reality 100&#956;m x 100&#956;m (=0.1 mm x 0.1 mm) in size.</p>

<h4>Parenchyma (inner layer) cell of a bluebell leaf.</h4>
Most of the inner cells of leaves contain chloroplasts (chl) in the thin rim of cytoplasm around the edge of the cell. This rim also contains a nucleus (n, with chloroplasts in front and behind) and many other much smaller organelles (specialised compartments). The vast majority of the plant cell is made up of a vacuole (v) filled with water and soluble substances. The cell section in this image is in reality 75&#956;m (=0.075 mm) wide.</p>

<h4>Chlorophyll autofluorescence in chloroplasts of a parenchyma cell in a bluebell leaf.</h4>
  <p>Chloroplasts are the compartments in a plant cell in which photosynthesis takes place. Photosynthesis is a process that uses light, water and carbon dioxide to produce sugars and oxygen. Without photosynthesis the earth would only be populated by bacteria. The network of membranes inside chloroplasts contains chlorophyll, which absorbs mostly blue and red light, and emits light in the far red part of the spectrum. The absorbed light is used for photosynthesis. The emitted fluorescent light from several chloroplasts is shown in this image. The biggest of these chloroplasts is 14&#956;m (=0.014 mm) in length.</p>
