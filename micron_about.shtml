        <p id="about_intro">Micron Oxford is a collaborative, multidisciplinary bioimaging unit working with biomedical researchers in the Oxford area and beyond to apply advanced cellular imaging techniques to address key questions in biology. We are located within the Department of Biochemistry and the Dunn School of Pathology in the South Parks Road science area at the University of Oxford, and are funded by a strategic award from the Wellcome Trust.
        <h3>Our Vision</h3>
        <div id="vision">
        We seek to understand the fundamental biological processes taking place in cells using advanced bioimaging technologies to observe and interfer with the components of molecular machines responsible for cellular function.  To achieve this goal we are:
        <ol>
          <li>Creating a collaborative and multidisciplinary environment that transcends 
              departmental boundaries and fosters innovative developments in microscopy, 
              molecular interference and tagging. </li>

          <li>Training pre/post-doctoral researchers in the application of advanced 
              imaging and related approaches, further enabling them to answer key questions 
              in their field of interest. </li>

          <li>Nurturing career development for research fellows, young PIs and support staff.</li>

          <li>Disseminating newly developed methodologies to the wider scientific community and 
              providing accessible information on Centre research and technology to a lay 
              audience. </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Micron is a community of researchers focusing on the development and use of state-of-the-art microscopy methods for imaging living cells. These interdisciplinary collaborative research groups are based in a number of Department in Oxford University including, the Department of Biochemistry, the Dunn School of Pathology, DPAG and the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics. Micron is funded by a major strategic award from the Wellcome Trust that includes staff salaries and large equipment purchases.</p>
        <p>Micron will focus on the use of very recently developed and emerging microscopy methods that allow cell biologists to image molecules in living cells at resolutions that exceed the conventional resolution limits. Imaging single molecules in living cells will allow the researchers to make major new discoveries and uncover the principles of how molecular machines function within cells. </p>

<p>The hub of the microscopy facilities is located in the New Biochemistry building where many of the groups are based. Leading the project are Professors Neil Brockdorff, Ilan Davis and Kim Nasmyth from the Biochemistry department, and Professors Nick Proudfoot, Jordan Raff and Elizabeth Robertson, from the Dunn School of Pathology. They will work with colleagues from the Departments of Chemistry, Engineering, Physics, and Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics, and at hospital sites, as well as researchers from the hospital sites in Oxford. Each group will bring its specific expertise and interest.</p>
