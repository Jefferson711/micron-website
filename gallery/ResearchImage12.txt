DNA replication. Optical cross section through a mouse epithelial cell nucleus imaged with 3D-SIM. The DNA replication machinery (green) is immunolabelled with an anti-PCNA antibody, post replicative DNA (red) is stained by EdU pulse labelling (red), and chromatin (blue) is stained with DAPI. The comparison with the conventional wide-field image (upper left) illustrates the increased level of details obtained with 3D-SIM (Lothar Schermelleh).
