		<h4>Latest Micron Publication - <a href="http://www.nature.com/srep/2015/150330/srep09583/full/srep09583.html">Johnson et al., Sci Reports 2015</a></h4>
        <p>Correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) combines the very distinct and complementary strengths of fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy. Besides the possibility of imaging living cells, in fluorescence microscopy structures or proteins of interest inside the cell can be labelled very specifically. This can be problematic or often even impossible with electron microscopy. On the other hand, electron microscopy allows structural details to be studied within the cellular context at a resolution in the range of a few nanometres, whereas the resolution in fluorescence microscopy is limited by the diffraction of light to around 200 nm.</p>
        <p>In the past 20 years, so-called super-resolution methods have been developed to overcome this resolution limit in fluorescence microscopy, which was last year recognised with the award of the Nobel price. Super-resolution imaging is helping to bridge the gap between fluorescence and electron microscopy. However, the requirements regarding sample preparation for both imaging modalities are very different. So far, performing super-resolution CLEM for imaging the same cell and combining the super-resolution fluorescence information with the ultrastructure of electron microscopy meant a big compromise. Either the resolution in the fluorescence images was not high enough for clear interpretation of the data or the structural preservation of the sample was deteriorated significantly, for example due to chemical fixation of the sample.</p>

         <h4>Comparison of resolution achieved with in-resin super-resolution CLEM. Left: Conventional wide-field fluorescence microscopy. Middle: Super-resolution SMLM. Right: TEM. The structural resolution of ~50 nm achieved with super-resolution SMLM in resin sections using standard fluorescence proteins (here mVenus) allowed a superior correlation of fluorescent signals and EM ultrastructure.</h4>
        <p>We have developed a method that ensures superior structural preservation of the sample whilst allowing uncompromised super-resolution imaging and sufficient contrast for high quality electron microscopy. In the first step, the sample is high pressure frozen, which immobilises it in glass-like amorphous ice (vitrification) and preserves the structure in a near-native state. A process of freeze substitution and resin embedding follows, during which the ice is slowly replaced by acetone, and then the acetone is replaced with resin, after which it is polymerised using UV light at a low temperature. The key for successful super-resolution CLEM using this approach is to preserve throughout the whole process the fluorescence in the sample and the photo-switching ability of the fluorescent molecules, on which super-resolution microscopy is crucially dependent on. We have identified the critical parameters during the process of high pressure freezing, freeze substitution and resin embedding and developed a method which enables in-resin super-resolution microscopy using standard fluorescent proteins at a resolution better than 50 nm followed by electron microscopy imaging of ultrathin sections. We found that the addition of tannic acid to the freeze substitution medium has a huge effect on the photo-switching of the fluorescent molecules, but at a certain level it also negatively affects the structural preservation. Here, it was important to find the right concentration of tannic acid to achieve optimal results with both imaging modalities. We demonstrate that our method works for a variety of different standard fluorescent proteins such as GFP, mVenus (an improved YFP) and mRuby2 (an improved RFP). Not having to use special photo-switchable fluorophores allows a quick and broad application of our method in the field of cell biology.</p>

        <p>
          Centrosomes are cellular organelles composed of two centrioles
          surrounded by a matrix of pericentriolar material (PCM). The PCM
          expands dramatically in size in mitosis, but it is unclear how this
          process occurs. Using a new super-resolution imaging technique
          developed at Micron, Raff and colleagues now clarify how the PCM
          matures.
        </p>
        <p>
          PCM maturation is an important step in mitosis. The increase in PCM
          size is correlated with an increase in microtubule nucleation ability,
          important for the formation of the mitotic spindle and correct
          chromosome segregation. The PCM is formed by hundreds of different
          proteins, but work now published by the Raff lab (Dunn School) in
          eLife suggests that this process relies on the interplay between
          only a few proteins.
        </p>
        <p>
          Raff and colleagues had previously used a technique known as
          "Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching" (FRAP) to show that
          the PCM protein Cnn displayed an unusual dynamic behavior, whereby
          it was only incorporated into the central region of the PCM and then
          spread outwards. Modifying the amount of Cnn in the PCM caused a
          corresponding change in the amount of PCM, suggesting that Cnn may
          form a scaffold that spreads away from the centrioles to support the
          extended PCM structure. In this paper, Raff and colleagues used FRAP
          to show that only one other protein, Spd-2, displayed a similar
          behaviour to Cnn and could also support PCM assembly. It was
          unclear, however, how these two scaffolds related to each other,
          particularly as standard resolution microscopy could not easily
          distinguish between them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The authors therefore turned to super-resolution structured
          illumination (3D-SIM) microscopy, available at Micron. Live two
          colour 3D-SIM revealed that the Spd2 and Cnn scaffolds only
          partially overlapped. This suggested that the two proteins behave
          differently, but in what way? To address this question, Micron
          developed a new technique that combined 3D-SIM with FRAP. This
          allowed the authors to examine the dynamics of Cnn and Spd-2 in
          unprecedented detail. Remarkably, this showed a clear difference
          between the two scaffolds: Spd-2 is initially recruited around the
          wall of the centriole and then moves outwards, whereas Cnn is
          initially recruited into a broader area and then spreads further
          outwards.
        </p>
        <p>
          These observations led the authors to carry out further experiments
          that collectively suggested a simple model for PCM maturation.
          Spd-2 is recruited to the centriole wall and then helps recruit Cnn.
          Cnn is modified by the kinase Polo/Plk1 and builds a scaffold that
          supports the outward movement of Spd-2. As Spd-2 moves outwards, it
          creates a larger area for Cnn recruitment, which in turn provides
          more support for the outward movement of Spd-2. Thus, a positive
          feedback loop is formed that allows the rapid expansion of the two
          scaffolds, which recruit the rest of the PCM, during mitosis.

        <p>
          Studying biological structures with fine details does not only
          require a microscope with high resolution, but also a sample
          preparation process that preserves the structures in a near-native
          state. Live-cell imaging is restricted mostly to the field of light
          microscopy. For studies requiring much higher resolution, fast
          freezing techniques (vitrification) are successfully used to
          immobilize the sample in a near-native state for imaging with
          electron and X-ray cryo-microscopy. Fluorescence cryo-microscopy
          combines imaging of vitrified samples with the advantages of
          fluorescence labeling of biological structures, but the advantages
          of vitrified specimens have not been fully exploited to date in
          fluorescence microscopy, because of the limited resolution of
          400-500 nm due to the lack of cryo-immersion objectives.
        </p>
        <p>
          We demonstrated how super-resolution imaging can be successfully
          applied for fluorescence cryo-microscopy to increase the resolution
          up to a factor of 5 at a temperature of -192°C. Using standard
          fluorescent proteins we were able to image biological structures
          in vitrified cells with a resolution of 125 nm and could locate
          individual molecules with an average precision of 40 nm. This
          technique is highly complementary to electron and X-ray
          cryo-microscopy and presents a powerful tool for imaging cellular
          structures in a near-native state at nanometer resolution.

        <h4>Wytham Woods Exhibition</h4>
        <p>
          Out of the Woods is an exhibition on Wytham Woods north of Oxford,
          the best studied piece of wood land in the world. The exhibition
          features prints and wood sculpture as well as photographs about
          life in the woods. We have contributed three large digital images
          that use fluorescence and DIC to capture the beauty of cells and
          organelles in bluebell leaves from Wytham Woods. The exhibition
          runs until 30 September 2012.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Stomata are closable pores through which gas is exchanged between
          the leaf and the environment. During the day they allow oxygen and
          water vapour to leave the leaf and air to enter while during the
          night carbon dioxide is expelled. The guard cells are the only
          cells in the epidermis that contain chloroplasts where
          photosynthesis takes place. The tissue shown in this image is in
          reality 100&#956;m x 100&#956;m (=0.1 mm x 0.1 mm) in size.

        <h4>Parenchyma (inner layer) cell of a bluebell leaf.</h4>

        <p>
          Most of the inner cells of leaves contain chloroplasts (chl) in
          the thin rim of cytoplasm around the edge of the cell. This rim
          also contains a nucleus (n, with chloroplasts in front and behind)
          and many other much smaller organelles (specialised compartments).
          The vast majority of the plant cell is made up of a vacuole (v)
          filled with water and soluble substances. The cell section in this
          image is in reality 75&#956;m (=0.075 mm) wide.

        <h4>Chlorophyll autofluorescence in chloroplasts of a parenchyma cell in a bluebell leaf.</h4>

        <p>
          Chloroplasts are the compartments in a plant cell in which
          photosynthesis takes place. Photosynthesis is a process that uses
          light, water and carbon dioxide to produce sugars and oxygen.
          Without photosynthesis the earth would only be populated by
          bacteria. The network of membranes inside chloroplasts contains
          chlorophyll, which absorbs mostly blue and red light, and emits
          light in the far red part of the spectrum. The absorbed light is
          used for photosynthesis. The emitted fluorescent light from several
          chloroplasts is shown in this image. The biggest of these
          chloroplasts is 14&#956;m (=0.014 mm) in length.
