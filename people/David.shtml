        <p id="person_intro">I am Micron's image analysis guy. I have experience with multiple
imaging systems and environment for their analysis but mainly, I want
to help users to establish automatic workflows for their analysis.
Under the alias of Carnë Draug, I have contributed to several FOSS
projects from text editors to build tools, always with the aim of
scratching some itch. I am currently also the maintainer of the
Octave's package for image processing.</p>

<p>However, my academic background is in Biology --- proper old-school
biology where you dissect owl vomit to assess population density of
different rodents --- and I have a real interest on the questions that
we can make computers answer.</p>

<p>So please, do come over and let's talk
about your projects over a cup of coffee.</p>
