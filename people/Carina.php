        <p id="person_intro">Carina has several years of experience in molecular biology, single-molecule biophysics and optics. 
After finishing her studies in pure Biology at the University of Coimbra, she did her PhD and first postdoc at the European Laboratory of Non-Linear Spectroscopy (LENS) in Florence. At LENS she combined dual optical tweezers, fluorescence imaging and microfluidics to study gene expression and regulation at the single molecule level. Then she moved to the Chemistry Department at the University of Oxford and King's College London for a postdoc in cell membrane biophysics. There she built several bespoke fluorescence microscopes suitable for TIRFM, widefield microscopy, polarisation, FRAP, smFRET and live cell applications. She is now the assistant manager at Micron. Come and meet her for any advice in terms of basic and advanced microscopy, sample preparation and experiment design.</p>
