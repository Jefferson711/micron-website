        <p id="person_intro">Dr. Korobchevskaya obtained her MSc degree from Novosibirsk State Technical University, Russia, in the field of physics of optical effects. She then joined the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT), Italy, for her PhD in the topic of femtosecond time resolved spectroscopy. Later she was a postdoctoral researcher in the Nanoscopy group at IIT for developing novel pump-probe microscope architecture for label-free super-resolution imaging.</p>

<p>With a strong background in laser physics, non-linear optics and ultrafast spectroscopy, she is now working on the super-resolution microscopy and focusing on the sub-cellular structures and biological processes. Currently, as a member of Biophysical Immunology group at KIR, she is developing SIM-TIRF microscope with enhanced resolution and fast acquisition speed, which will allow us to study spatiotemporal dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton in health and disease.</p>
