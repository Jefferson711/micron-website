        <h3>Micron Sample Preparation Laboratory</h3>
        <p>New Biochemistry Room 00-058 </p>
        <br/>

        <p>
          Room 00-058 is a prep lab area in the basement close to the OMX microscope rooms. It can be used by anyone who wants to prepare their samples for imaging close to the microscopes. We have a very good dissection microscope with the option of illumination from the side or from below. There is a freezer, a fridge, a cooled centrifuge for microfuge tubes, 15 and 50 mL tubes, a laminar flow hood, a heat block for microfuge tubes, an incubator/shaker for tubes and a vortex mixer. There is also an incubator for flies and an incubator for mammalian cells in addition to the one in the microscope room 00-030. You are not allowed to bring adult flies into the lab, but larvae, embryos, etc., are no problem.
