        <p>
          This microscope was custom-built by the Kapanidis lab in Physics. It
          can be used for PALM and dSTORM experiments under TIRF or near-TIRF
          conditions up to 1 Âµm into the cell. Both methods are used to
          localise single molecules beyond the diffraction limit. TIRF and
          near-TIRF localisation is limited to 2D with no z-information.
          Localisation accuracy depends on a high number of detected photons
          and on only a fraction of molecules being in a fluorescent state at
          any one time. The latter is achieved in PALM by the activation of
          only a few fluorophores at the same time, which then bleach
          irreversibly, and in dSTORM by reversible switching between a
          fluorescent on-state and a dark off-state. PALM uses photoactivatable
          fluorescent proteins and dSTORM images fluorescent organic dyes.
          Cells need to be in an aqueous medium and for dSTORM need to be
          imaged in switching buffer.
