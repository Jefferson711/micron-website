    <h2>A Short Introduction to Super-Resolution Microscopy</h2>
    <p>by J. Demmerle, C. Eggeling & L. Schermelleh</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The past decade has seen a number of exciting new fluorescence imaging techniques emerge, many of which fall under the umbrella of “Super-Resolution Microscopy”. There are many remaining challenges in the application of these methods to biological specimens as well as a lack of expertise and tools to evaluate the quality of the resulting data. At Micron Oxford we work to advance these techniques and bridge the gap between complex technical developments and their biological application in order to make cutting-edge imaging available to researchers in Oxford and beyond.</p>
    <p>If you are a novice in the field you may ask: What are the differences between the seemingly endless array of techniques and acronyms in the super-resolution field? What are the relative strengths and weaknesses of different approaches?  How would my research benefit? Which technique is most applicable for my question? In this introduction we will give a brief overview of the state of the field, and address some pros and cons of each method. </p>
    <h4>The Limits of Light</h4>
    <p>Light microscopy is one of the most versatile tools in a biologist’s arsenal, but from its invention in the 17th century until a few decades ago it was constrained by a seemingly impenetrable barrier: the diffraction limit. Simply put, the diameter of the smallest discernible object equals the wavelength used to observe it divided by twice the numerical aperture (NA) of the microscope. With visible light, the smallest practical wavelength is around 450 nm (blue emission), and the largest NA possible is around 1.4. Even with advances such as confocal microscopy and deconvolution algorithms, only biological structures larger than 200 nm in the lateral dimension (x and y axis) could be discerned. Resolution in the axial dimension (z axis) is even lower, being limited to roughly the wavelength of the emitted light, or 500 nm at best. Further, these values are only theoretical limits under optimal optical conditions. The effective resolution for typical biological samples is significantly decreased due to distortions from the sample itself such as light scattering, out-of-focus blur, spherical aberration, and poor signal-to-noise ratios.  </p>
    <h4>Breaking the Diffraction Barrier – A Menagerie of Options</h4>
    <p>Sub-diffraction limit techniques were postulated in the early 20th century, and while significant theoretical advances were made starting in the late ‘70s only in the last decade have these technologies become available to the average researcher. There are three major approaches to super-resolution light microscopy: single-molecule localization microscopy (e.g. PALM, STORM); structured illumination microscopy (SIM); and stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy. </p>
    <h4>Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy </h4>
    <p>STORM, dSTORM, PALM, fPALM, PALMIRA, SPDM, GSDIM, BaLM, and PAINT are all included in this category. Using a conventional or TIRF light path, various strategies are used to collect fluorescent emissions from only a small fraction of the total fluorophores marking the structure of interest in any one image. This is repeated thousands of times, and in post processing each fluorophore is assumed to represent the smallest possible object, as delineated by its point spread function (PSF) From these thousands of individual points, the full image can be assembled. For more details see <a href="localization-microscopy.shtml">Rainer Kaufmann’s section on localization microscopy</a>.

      <p><b>Resolution:</b> Localization accuracy is typically around 20 nm (depending on the photon statistics), while structural resolution depends on the labeling density and can reach down to 50 nm laterally. The axial resolution is either unchanged (in conventional far-field) or 120-200 nm (in TIRF mode). Improvements to 50-80 nm axial localization accuracy are possible using special setups (e.g. biplane detection, astigmatism imaging), but at the price of reduced lateral resolution and increased complexity. </p>
                    <p><b>Pros:</b>
                    <ul class="researchlist">
<li>•	High localization precision (< 20 nm).</li>
<li>•	Quantification of single molecules (e.g., cluster analysis, single particle tracking).</li>
<li>•	Excellent delineation of small, punctate, or filamentous objects such as discrete macromolecular complexes. </li>
<li>•	Relatively simple instrumentation. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b>
<ul class="researchlist"> 
<li>•	Long imaging times (often in the tens of minutes).</li>
<li>•	Frequently requires fluorophores and imaging media with special optical properties, due to photophysical constraints.</li>
<li>•	Typically can image one plane only (no 3D sectioning).</li>
<li>•	Works best with TIRF setup and with fixed samples.</li>
<li>•	In TIRF, confinement of imaging to regions within few hundred nanometers of the coverslip (essentially limited to 2D structures).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Applications:</b> 
<ul class="researchlist">
<li>•   Imaging cell surface or distinct features with little z-extension. Particularly useful for: membranes; receptors; adhesion complexes; protein clustering and single particle tracking (sptSTORM).</li>
<li>•	Successful imaging depends on the reconstruction algorithm and requires the right choice of dyes, embedding condition and high labeling density. </li>
</ul>   		 
</p>  

<h3>3D-Structured Illumination Microscopy</h3>
<p>Super-resolution 3D-structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) works by the interference of a high frequency three-dimensionally modulated illumination pattern with high frequency variations in the sample fluorescence. These two patterns interact and the resulting Moiré fringes contain otherwise non-resolvable structural information shifted to a lower frequency that can be imaged by the microscope. By computational post-processing the sample’s sub-diffraction resolutions structure can be algorithmically reconstructed. By having stripes in the Z axis and including information from above and below the focal plane, axial resolution is also improved. In practical terms, a z-stack with 15 raw images per plane is acquired with a striped pattern shifted in 5 steps and rotated at  3 different angles. Reconstructed images are optically sectioned (similar to confocal imaging) and the technique allows imaging in the entire axial dimension of a biological specimen, down to a depth of 10-20 µm. Using normal, linear, fluorescence the resolution increase is restricted to a factor of two below the classical diffraction limit. Extending the principle to a non-linear regime using fluorescence saturation, switchable dyes or other non-linear effects can overcome this barrier, but requires more complexity and images. {For more details see (forthcoming) section on SIM.}   </p>

                    <p><b>Resolution:</b> : Lateral resolution of 100-130 nm dependent on the wavelength, and axial resolution 280-350 nm. I.e., a 2-fold improvement in lateral and axial directions, or an 8-fold volumetric improvement.</p>
                    <p><b>Pros: </b>
                    <ul class="researchlist">
<li>•	SIM can be used with conventional fluorophores (e.g., DAPI, Alexa, ATTO, GFP, YFP, etc.)</li>
<li>•	3D sectioning over 10 µm into a sample (ideal for cultured cells).</li>
<li>•	Fast pattern generation (OMX Blaze) and rapid image collection (e.g., by using recently developed sCMOS cameras) enable very high imaging speed and are suitability for live-cell imaging.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><b>Cons:</b>
<ul class="researchlist"> 
<li>•	Only moderate lateral resolution improvement compared to other methods.</li>
<li>•	Particularly susceptible to artifacts caused by sample structure and preparation.</li>
<li>•	Errors in system calibration and/or poor sample quality can severely compromise resolution.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><b>Applications:</b>
<ul class="researchlist"> 
<li>•	Multicolor imaging of 3D structures, e.g. cytoskeletal networks; centrosomes; nuclear organization.</li>
<li>•	Live-cell applications. </li>
<li>•	High labeling contrast and optical aberration correction are of utmost importance.</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h3>Stimulated Emission Depletion</h3>
<p>STED microscopy relies on using a second laser beam to deplete emission fluorescence around the point being illuminated. Imagine that with a normal confocal scanning laser microscope you can image a point of a certain diameter. Now imagine a doughnut-shaped second laser beam suppressing the exited fluorophores, leaving only the “hole” in the doughnut to be collected by the detector. Of note, the effective resolution increase scales non-linearly with the depletion energy and is theoretically unlimited. In practice the sophistication of the laser and the photophysical properties of the dyes set the limit. For more details see <a href="http://www2.bioch.ox.ac.uk/nanogroup/nano_home.php">Christian Eggeling’s section on STED</a>.

                    width="880" height="261" alt="Figure 3 STED microscopy" title="Figure 3 STED microscopy">       <p><b>Resolution:</b> Current commercial setups currently achieve a lateral resolution of 50-80 nm with an axial resolution in the 500-800 nm range, equal to the conventional confocal axial resolution.</p>
                    <p><b>Pros:</b>
                    <ul class="researchlist"> 
<li>•	“What you see is what you get”; no algorithms required.</li> 
<li>•	High lateral resolution.</li> 
<li>•	Can image over 20 µm deep into the sample.</li>

</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b>
<ul class="researchlist">
<li>•	Fluorophore options are limited: 2 colors only, and UV is not an option. </li>
<li>•	Requires high depletion energies; photobleaching can be a problem.</li>
<li>•	Speed scales with the scan size and can become relative slow for larger fields.</li>
<li>•	Not optimal for 3D and live-cell imaging of larger objects.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Applications:</b>
<ul class="researchlist"> 
<li>•	Ideal for distinct structural features with little z-extension, e.g. vesicles; membranes; synaptic behavior.</li>
<li>•	Bright labeling and the right choice of dyes are critical.</li>
</ul>

<h4>It’s Both Better and Worse Than It Seems</h4>
<p>Two things should always be kept in mind when considering the super-resolution options at one’s disposal. Firstly, the technology is constantly advancing, and some of the statements in this introduction may have become obsolete by the time you read it – for example, localization techniques are experiencing rapid improvements at multi-channel acquisition and Z resolution. Secondly, many of the resolutions and a few of the techniques cited are ceilings, achieved in highly specialized labs with custom-built systems that may not be practical for the average researcher. Most of the techniques discussed here are available commercially, but performance can vary, and getting the best from any of these techniques requires knowledge and experience.</p>

<h4>Trade-offs – There’s No Free Lunch</h4>

<p>You may be tempted to go and lobby for your very own super-resolution system immediately, but remember that there are many things to take into account. Resolution is only part of the equation - you may value multi-color imaging, in vivo observations, high-speed imaging, three-dimensional imaging, or low labeling intensities. Each priority comes with a compromise in another area, and the optimal technique will be entirely dependent on the specific demands of your experiment and how you want to spend your given photon budget.</p>

                    <h3>Getting Started!</h3>
                    <p>Once you ensure these issues are resolved, you can proceed with acquiring fantastic images. Your best bet is to visit your institution’s imaging core and talk to the facility manager. If you are based at Oxford, then feel free to visit the Micron office in the basement of New Biochemistry. If you are based at another institution, feel free to send us an email. The Micron team is well equipped to help you decide which technology is most suited to address your question, what reagents you may need, how to prepare the samples, and how to create suitable image acquisition and post-processing workflows. It may seem like a lot of work, but once you’re generating data and seeing structures at the sub-200 nm resolution, you’ll be hooked. </p>
